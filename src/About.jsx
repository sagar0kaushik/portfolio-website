      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
       Hey there!  I’m Sagar Kaushik, a passionate and curious Computer Science undergrad from Rajasthan Technical University, expected to graduate in 2026. I'm the kind of person who finds just as much thrill in squashing a bug in code as I do discovering a new banger in my music playlist.

My journey into tech kicked off with a love for logic and a knack for problem-solving. Since then,
 I’ve dived deep into the world of web development, sharpening my skills in React.js, JavaScript,
  HTML/CSS, and even getting my hands dirty with C++ and Firebase. Whether it’s building responsive UIs,
   crafting clever CRUD apps, or whipping up dynamic password generators, I love creating things that actually work 
   — and look good doing it.
      </p>

      <h2>What I've Been Up To </h2>
      <p>Web Dev Intern @ Uddharana (Jul–Sep 2024): Built sleek, responsive interfaces and tackled real-world web projects like a boss. </p>

      <p>Web App Dev @ Chai or Code (Mar–Jun 2024): Gained ninja skills in React, Firebase, and built stuff like a Todo List and CRUD app. </p>

       <p>C++ Developer Intern @ Deadlock (May–Jun 2023): Flexed my OOP muscles building cool lil' games like Tic-Tac-Toe.</p>
     
     
     <h2>Projects I’m Proud Of </h2>
     <p>
      CRUD App (React): Full-on functionality with a clean UI — create, read, update, delete, repeat! </p>

       <p>Password Generator: Strong, secure, and sexy passwords at your fingertips. </p>

         <p>Todo List: Manage your chaos with a minimal, interactive interface.
     </p>


     <h2>Tech I Speak </h2>
     <p>Languages: C, C++, JavaScript </p>
      <p>Frameworks/Tools: React.js, Firebase, GitHub </p>
        <p>Concepts: OOP, DSA</p>
       <p>Extras: Good ol’ MS Word & PowerPoint (because sometimes, you gotta present your genius)</p>
      
      
      <h2>Outside the Code</h2>
      <p>When I’m not debugging code or pushing to GitHub, you’ll probably catch me vibing to some tunes, binge-watching a coding tutorial, or plotting my next project. I believe learning never stops, and the best way to grow is to keep building, breaking, and rebuilding.</p>

      <p>So yeah — that’s me, in bytes and beats. Let’s connect, collab, or just geek out over code and caffeine.</p>
